No!,"They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast."
"Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!","This is the part where you run away. And stay out!  ""Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."""
You there. Ogre!,Aye?
By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.,"Oh, really? You and what army?"
"Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!",Are you talkin' to... me?  Whoa!
"Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.","Oh, that's great. Really."
"Man, it's good to be free.","Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?"
"But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time... ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.",Why are you following me?
"I'll tell you why.  'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith...",Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.
Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.,"Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?"
Uh ...really Can I stay with you?,Of course! Outside! I thought I told you to
What?,"I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy?  Oh, no. No! No! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on!  No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.  Oh!"
"Oh, gosh, no one invited us.",What?
We were forced to come here.,By who? All right. Who knows where
"Oh, I do. I know where he is.",Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?
Me! Me!,Anyone?
"Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!","Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy"
But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.,"So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle."
Uh-huh. That's the place.,Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?
"Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.","Hey, you!  Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?"
Wow! Let's do that again!,"No. No. No, no, no! No."
Brave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...,All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.
"That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.  Let the tournament begin!  Oh! What is that? It's hideous!","Ah, that's not very nice. Can't we just"
"Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!",Yeah!
The chair! Give him the chair!,"Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!"
"No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!",What?
"Congratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.","Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back."
Your swamp?,"Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!"
"Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.",Exactly the way it was?
Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.,And the squatters?
As good as gone.,What kind of quest?
Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?,"You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk."
"I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.","Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?"
"Uh, no, not really, no.","For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think."
Example?,"Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions."
"They stink? Oh, you both Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?","Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location."
"Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?","Oh, aye."
"Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.",Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
You know what I mean.,You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
"No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!","Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time."
Really?,"Really, really."
"Okay, that makes me feel so much better.",Just keep moving. And don't look down.
"Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down.  Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!",But you're already halfway.
But I know that half is safe!,"Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back."
"Shrek, no! Wait!","Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?"
Don't do that!,"Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this?"
"Yes, that!","Yes? Yes, do it. Okay."
"No, Shrek! No! Stop it!",You said do it! I'm doin' it.
"I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!","That'll do, Donkey. That'll do."
Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?,"Inside, waiting for us to rescue her."
"I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. You afraid?",No.
But...,Shh.
"Oh, good. Me neither.  'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.","Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs."
Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.,The princess will
I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.,"Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the..."
Dragon!,"Donkey, look out!  Got ya!"
Oh! Oh!,Wake up!
What?,Are you Princess Fiona?
"I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.","Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!"
"But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?","Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time."
"Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.","You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?"
Mm-hmm. But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!,I don't think so.
Can I at least know the name of my champion?,"Uh, Shrek."
Sir Shrek.  I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.,Thanks!
You didn't slay the dragon?,It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
"But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.","Yeah, right before they burst into flame."
That's not the point.  Oh!  Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.,"Well, I have to save my ass."
What kind of knight are you?,One of a kind.
It talks!,"Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. Oh! Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. Run!"
What is so funny?,"Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea."
Just take off the helmet.,I'm not going to.
Take it off.,No!
Now!,Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.
You- - You're a- - an ogre.,"Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming."
"Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre.","Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you."
Then why didn't he come rescue me?,Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.
"Well, so much for noble steed.",You're not making my job any easier.
"I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.","Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right?  I'm a delivery boy."
You wouldn't dare. Put me down!,"Ya comin', Donkey?"
And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?,"Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply."
"I don't know. There are those who think little of him.  Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.","Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the ""measuring"" when you see him tomorrow."
Tomorrow?,Hey! Over here.
"No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.",Homey touches? Like what?
"Shrek, What are you doing?","I just- - You know - - Oh, And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields."
"Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?","The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for."
I know you're making this up.,"No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench."
That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.,"You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it."
"Hey, Shrek, what Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.",Oh! For the love of Pete!
What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?,"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone."
"You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.","Yeah, I know."
"So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?","Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying."
"Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?",That's the moon.
"Mmm, yeah, you know I like",What's all this about?
"You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.","Uh, thanks."
Shrek!,"What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say."
She's as nasty as you are.,"You know, you're not exactly"
La liberte! Hey!,Princess!
"Uh, shall we?","Hold the phone.  Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?"
What?,That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?
"Well... when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a... there's an arrow in your butt!","What?  Oh, would you look at that?"
For getting rid,Ow! Hey! Easy with the
"I'm sorry, but it has to come out.","No, it's tender."
"Now, hold on.",What you're doing is the opposite of help.
Don't move.,"Look, time out."
"Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.",Ow!
It's just,"Nothing There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you."
"Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really... Ow!","Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move on."
"Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.",What?
That's Dead. Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?,"Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style."
"No kidding. Well, this is delicious.","Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew."
I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.,"Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it."
I'd like that.,"Um, Princess?"
"Yes, Shrek?","I, um, I was wondering...are you... Are you gonna eat that?"
"Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's Good night.",Good night.
Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.,"Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
"I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.",You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.
"Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel.","I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm"
An ogre?,Yeah. An ogre.
"Hey, where you goin'?",To get... move firewood.
Shrek?,"Princess, I - - Uh, how's"
"I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him.  Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want... Shrek. Are you all right?",Perfect! Never been better.
I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.,"You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night."
You heard what I said?,Every word.
I thought you'd understand.,"Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"""
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.,"Yeah? Well, it does.  Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something."
Princess Fiona.,As promised. Now hand it over.
"Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.",Yeah? So what?
"Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -","I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?"
"Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.","I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!"
But I thought - -,Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!
Shrek.,Donkey?  What are you doing?
"I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.","Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it."
"It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.",Oh! Your half. Hmm.
"Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.",Back off!
"No, you back off.",This is my swamp!
Our swamp.,"Let go, Donkey! Go away! Love me? She said I was ugly, a She wasn't Donkey?"
I guess it's just my animal magnetism.,"Aw, come here, you."
"Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN.",What are you talking
"And so, by the power vested in me...",What do you see?
Mother Fletcher! He already said it.,"Oh, for the love of Pete! I object!"
"Oh, now what does he want?","Hi, everyone. Havin'"
"""By night","Well, uh, that explains a lot."
Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both!,"No, no!"
"No, let go of me! Shrek!",No!
"Don't just stand there, you morons.",Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!
"All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? Go ahead, Shrek.","Uh, Fiona?"
"Yes, Shrek?",I - - I love you.
