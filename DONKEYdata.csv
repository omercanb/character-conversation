He can talk!,"Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!  Uh-oh."
"Oh, really? You and what army?","Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!"
Are you talkin' to... me?  Whoa!,"Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that."
"Oh, that's great. Really.","Man, it's good to be free."
"Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?","But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time... ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day."
Why are you following me?,"I'll tell you why.  'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith..."
Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.,Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.
"Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?",Uh ...really Can I stay with you?
Of course! Outside! I thought I told you to,I am outside.
"I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy?  Oh, no. No! No! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on!  No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.  Oh!","Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them."
By who? All right. Who knows where,"Oh, I do. I know where he is."
Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?,Me! Me!
Anyone?,"Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!"
"Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy",On the road again. Sing it
"So, just sit back Bachelorette",But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
"So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.",Uh-huh. That's the place.
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?,"Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek."
"Hey, you!  Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?","Hey, look at this!"
Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town,Wow! Let's do that again!
All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.,Sorry about that.
"Ah, that's not very nice. Can't we just","Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!"
What kind of quest?,Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
"You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.","I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip."
"Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?","Uh, no, not really, no."
"For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.",Example?
"Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.","They stink? Oh, you both Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?"
"Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.","Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?"
"Oh, aye.","Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves."
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.,You know what I mean.
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.,"No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!"
"Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.",Really?
"Really, really.","Okay, that makes me feel so much better."
Just keep moving. And don't look down.,"Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down.  Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!"
But you're already halfway.,But I know that half is safe!
"Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.","Shrek, no! Wait!"
"Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?",Don't do that!
"Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this?","Yes, that!"
"Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.","No, Shrek! No! Stop it!"
You said do it! I'm doin' it.,"I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!"
"That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.",Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?
"Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.","I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. You afraid?"
No.,But...
Shh.,"Oh, good. Me neither.  'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that."
"Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.",Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.
The princess will,I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.
"Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...",Dragon!
"Donkey, look out!  Got ya!","Oh! Aah! Aah! No. Oh, no, No!  Oh, what large teeth you have.  I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. What's the matter with you?"
One of a kind.,"Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. Hi, Princess!"
You a little,You think Shrek is your true love!
"But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet.","Well, so much for noble steed."
"Ya comin', Donkey?",I'm right behind ya.
"Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!","Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?"
You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your... Hey! The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.,"You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!"
"Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.","I don't know. There are those who think little of him.  Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad."
Hey! Over here.,"Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess."
"A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.",You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.
I said good night!,"Shrek, What are you doing?"
"I just- - You know - - Oh, And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.","Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?"
"The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.",I know you're making this up.
"No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.",That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
"You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.","Hey, Shrek, what Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere."
Oh! For the love of Pete!,What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?
"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.","You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre."
"Yeah, I know.","So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?"
"Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.","Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?"
That's the moon.,"Oh, okay."
Ah. Perfect.,"Mmm, yeah, you know I like"
"Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.",Shrek!
"What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say.","Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess."
Thanks.,She's as nasty as you are.
"Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.",Why? What's wrong?
Would you... Okay. What do you propose we do?,"Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns."
That's DuLoc?,"Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really... Ow!"
"I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.",What are you talking about? I'm fine.
"I, um, I was wondering...are you... Are you gonna eat that?","Man, isn't this romantic?"
Good night.,Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.
"Oh, what are you talkin' about?","I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it."
You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.,"Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel."
"I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm",An ogre?
Yeah. An ogre.,"Hey, where you goin'?"
To get... move firewood.,"Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games. Aah!"
"Oh, no!","No, help!"
Shh!,Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
"No, it's okay. It's okay.",What did you do with the princess?
"Donkey, I'm the princess.",Aah!
"It's me, in this body.","Oh, my God! You ate the princess.  Can you hear me?"
Donkey!,"Listen, Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different."
"I'm ugly, okay?","Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - -"
No. I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.,"What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before."
"It only happens when sun goes down. ""By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form.""","Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry."
"It's a spell.  When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.","All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7."
"But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.","Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?"
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.,"But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a lot in common."
"I can't just marry whoever I want. My only chance to live happily Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.",You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.,What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
Promise you won't tell. Promise!,"All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.  I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'."
"Yeah? Well, it does.  Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something.",What'd I miss? What'd I miss?   Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey.
Excellent! I'll start,"Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away."
Yeah? So what?,"Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -"
"I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?","Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you."
"I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!",But I thought - -
Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!,Shrek.
Donkey?  What are you doing?,"I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one."
"Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.","It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half."
Oh! Your half. Hmm.,"Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head."
Back off!,"No, you back off."
This is my swamp!,Our swamp.
"Let go, Donkey! Go away! Love me? She said I was ugly, a She wasn't Donkey?",I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
"Aw, come here, you.","All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet."
Go on.,"Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN."
What are you talking,Then you The chicks love that romantic
What do you see?,The whole town's in there.
I now pronounce you husband and wife...,They're at the altar.
...king and queen.,Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
And I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - -  Aaaah! Aah!,"All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? Go ahead, Shrek."
"Well,",I was hoping this would be
"God bless us, every one.","Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't"
